# Slimer

Slimer exposes useful tools for working with Node.js repos. Much of this package is a set of commands, and a wrapper for generator-slimer.
 
Access to these tools is provided via `slimer-cli`.

## Install

Add the CLI to your globals:

- `npm install --global @tryghost/slimer-cli`

## Develop

This is a mono repository, managed with [lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

Follow the instructions for the top-level repo.

## Test

- `yarn lint` run just eslint
- `yarn test` run lint && tests
